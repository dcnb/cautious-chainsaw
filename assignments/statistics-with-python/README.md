# 📘 Assignment: Statistics with Python

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to perform statistical analysis and calculations using Python libraries pandas and numpy. You'll work with datasets to calculate descriptive statistics, analyze distributions, and visualize statistical relationships.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Calculate Descriptive Statistics

#### Description
Load a dataset and calculate basic descriptive statistics including measures of central tendency and spread. You'll use pandas and numpy to analyze the data and understand its distribution.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Load a CSV dataset using pandas
- Calculate mean, median, and mode for numerical columns
- Calculate standard deviation, variance, and range
- Display quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) and interquartile range (IQR)
- Identify and report any outliers using the IQR method


### 🛠️	Analyze Data Distribution

#### Description
Create visualizations to understand how the data is distributed and identify patterns. Use matplotlib or seaborn to create statistical plots.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Create a histogram showing the distribution of at least one variable
- Generate a box plot to visualize quartiles and outliers
- Create a scatter plot to show relationships between two variables
- Calculate and display correlation coefficients between numerical variables
- Save all visualizations as image files


### 🛠️	Perform Statistical Comparisons

#### Description
Compare different groups or categories within the dataset using statistical methods. Analyze differences and summarize findings.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Group data by a categorical variable (e.g., category, type, group)
- Calculate summary statistics for each group
- Compare means or medians across groups
- Create a grouped bar chart or comparison visualization
- Write a brief summary of the statistical findings (as code comments or printed output)
